As a consequence, state-sanctioned death has become a necessity\n           to curb population growth, and a global organization of\n           professional killers known as Scythes have been tasked with the carrying out of this less than palatable\n           business.\"]\n\n      [:p \"But while it is acknowledged by the government, this organization is neither controlled by\n           nor amenable to it.
