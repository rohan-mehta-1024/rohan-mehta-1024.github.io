But I was beyond rewarded\n            with a masterfully told story that I will forever associate\n            with dystopian fiction at its finest, and so finshing it\n            leaves me with mixed emotions.\"]\n\n      [:p \"The trilogy examines the idea of a \" [:q \"post-mortal\"] \" world \u2013 a place\n           where the steady advancement of medical technology has rendered almost all once-fatal\n           injuries but a minor annoyance. As a consequence, state-sanctioned death has become a necessity\n           to curb population growth, and a global organization of\n           professional killers known as Scythes have been tasked with the carrying out of this less than palatable\n           business.\"]\n\n      [:p \"But while it is acknowledged by the government, this organization \u2013 known as\n           the Scythedom \u2013 is neither controlled by\n           nor amenable to it. In fact, perhaps \" [:q \"organization\"] \" is the wrong\n           word alltogther. Something along the lines of a cult would be more accurate, for those\n           charged with taking the lives of others for a living are invariably led\n           to style themselves as either angels or devils, often with very little distinction.\"]\n\n   [:p  \"Regardless, their ability to act as judge, jury, and executioner whenever and wheresoever\n         they please has erned Scythes the status of gods. Beholden to but ten commandments,\n         they can more or less do what they please when they please it, and all that keeps\n         them from turning are their increasingly lax morals, which unsurprisingly,\n         represents the main conflict of the story.\"]\n\n      [:p \"That is, in and of itself, an exotic enough idea to grab anyone's attention. But\n           the truly genius move on Shusterman's part comes from the context that this bizzarely unfolds in.\n           Because while its power may seem absolute, the Scythedom only has jurasdiction over the dead.\n           The world of the living, on the other hand, is governed by the Thunderhead:\n           a benevolent, quasi-omnipotent (in its own words) general artifical intelligence.\"]\n\n\n      [:p \"The Toll closes the trilogy, and in my opinion, does so magnificently.\n           It would be too monumental a task and try to do Shusterman's entire world\n           justice in such a short reflection, so I'll focus instead on what I found\n           most appealing about\n            to try andBut most of all it closes things spectacularly.\n           Too many a wonderful series stumble at the finish light, caught in\n           an unatural act to tie things up neatly\n           It builds out the of the more recent charactories, and the elegance\n           in how it solves is. It is not just victory, there is an element of\n           loss in it too. But most of all, it ends things perfectly.
