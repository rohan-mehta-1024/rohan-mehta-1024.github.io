From there, we can extrapolate the concept to other problem domains.  With this in mind, let\u2019s consider how we might program self-attention into a neural net for some language task. A key part of the attentional paradigm is being able to selectively incorporate information from other sources  \u2013 in the case of self-attention specifically, from other elements of the input. In our example, this equates to other words. But how exactly do we represent this information?\n\nA naive implementation might encode each word into a one-hot vector that considers the first thousand-or-so most common words. This would (obviously) not only be computationally inefficient, but fail to make full use of all the properties of the embedding space. For one, the space would be very sparsely populated, with only the pure unit vectors () of the space holding any real semantic meaning, and as a consequence all representations would be orthogonal to one another \u2013 in other words, equally different. This is not a faithful depiction of the words being represented though, as some are definitely more similar than others and giving the networks this information explicitly will help in making their outputs similar too. But how exactly do we make words with similar meanings \u201Ccloser\u201D and vice versa?\n\nThis is a problem the famous word2vec paper solved with learnable embeddings (in other words, using neural networks to produce representations with the properties we want), and it\u2019s far from a new idea either. In fact, learnable embeddings are used for essentially all language tasks nowadays. I retell it only to explicitly acknowledge the idea that how we represent data is a choice, and that to represent it in such a way that exposes valuable information to our network we sometimes must learn those representations themselves. In other words, we must be able to learn the representations we want to learn with.\n\nIn most cases, this would be enough. We\u2019ve computed representations which give the network a sense of how words are related and provided it with an embedding space powerful enough to encode new words as it encounters them. But we also want a way to calculate how much attention any given word should focus on another, preferably by the same metric (closness) as it is relatively cheap and easy to compute (via the dot product).  The only problem is that we\u2019ve already optimized the similarity between two vectors under the perspective of the similarity between the meanings of the words they represent.
