It does **not** queue\n  the event for handling later as `dispatch` does. \n  \n  `event` is a vector and the first element is typically a keyword \n  which identifies the kind of event.\n\n  It is an error to use `dispatch-sync` within an event handler because \n  you can't immediately process an new event when one is already\n  part way through being processed.\n\n  Generally, avoid using this function, and instead, use `dispatch`. \n  Only use it in the narrow set of cases where any delay in \n  processing is a problem:\n\n    1. the `:on-change` handler of a text field where we are expecting fast typing\n    2. when initialising your app - see 'main' in examples/todomvc/src/core.cljs\n    3. in a unit test where immediate, synchronous processing is useful\n\n  Usage:\n\n      (dispatch-sync [:sing :falsetto \\\"piano accordion\\\"])\n  \"\n  [event]\n  (router/dispatch-sync event))\n\n\n;; -- subscriptions -----------------------------------------------------------\n(defn reg-sub\n  \"A call to `reg-sub` associates a `query-id` WITH two functions.\n   \n  The two functions provide 'a mechanism' for creating a node \n  in the Signal Graph. When a node of type `query-id` is needed, \n  the two functions can be used to create it.\n  \n  The three arguments are: \n   \n  - `query-id` - typically a namespaced keyword (later used in subscribe)\n  - optionally, an `input signals` function which returns the input data\n    flows required by this kind of node. \n  - a `computation function` which computes the value (output) of the \n    node (from the input data flows)\n     \n  Later, during app execution, a call to `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 :blue])`,\n  will trigger the need for a new `:sub-id` Signal Graph node (matching the \n  query `[:sub-id 3 :blue]`). And, to create that node the two functions \n  associated with `:sub-id` will be looked up and used.\n\n  Just to be clear: calling `reg-sub` does not immediately create a node. \n  It only registers 'a mechanism' (the two functions) by which nodes \n  can be created later, when a node is bought into existence by the \n  use of `subscribe` in a `View Function`.\n\n  The `computation function` is expected to take two arguments:\n  \n    - `input-values` - the values which flow into this node (how is it wierd into the graph?)\n    - `query-vector` - the vector given to `subscribe`\n  \n  and it returns a computed value (which then becomes the output of the node)\n\n  When `computation function` is called, the 2nd `query-vector` argument will be that \n  vector supplied to the `subscribe`. So, if the call was `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 :blue])`,\n  then the `query-vector` supplied to the computaton function will be `[:sub-id 3 :blue]`.\n\n  The argument(s) supplied to `reg-sub` between `query-id` and the `computation-function` \n  can vary in 3 ways, but whatever is there defines the `input signals` part \n  of `the mechanism`, specifying what input values \\\"flow into\\\" the \n  `computation function` (as the 1st argument) when it is called.\n\n  So, `reg-sub` can be called in one of three ways, because there are three ways \n  to define the input signals part. But note, the 2nd method, in which a \n  `signals function` is explicitly supplied, is the most canonical and \n  instructive. The other two are really just sugary variations.\n\n  **First variation** - no input signal function given:\n\n      (reg-sub\n        :query-id\n        a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n\n     In the absence of an explicit `signals function`, the node's input signal defaults to `app-db`\n     and, as a result, the value within `app-db` (a map) is\n     is given as the 1st argument when `a-computation-fn` is called.\n\n\n  **Second variation** - a signal function is explicitly supplied:\n\n      (reg-sub\n        :query-id\n        signal-fn     ;; <-- here\n        computation-fn)\n\n  This is the most canonical and instructive of the three variations.\n\n  When a node is created from the template, the `signal function` will be called and it\n  is expected to return the input signal(s) as either a singleton, if there is only\n  one, or a sequence if there are many, or a map with the signals as the values.\n\n  The current values of the returned signals will be supplied as the 1st argument to\n  the `a-computation-fn` when it is called - and subject to what this `signal-fn` returns,\n  this value will be either a singleton, sequence or map of them (paralleling\n  the structure returned by the `signal function`).\n\n  This example `signal function` returns a 2-vector of input signals.\n\n      (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n         [(subscribe [:a-sub])\n          (subscribe [:b-sub])])\n\n  The associated computation function must be written\n  to expect a 2-vector of values for its first argument:\n\n      (fn [[a b] query-vec]     ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n        ....)\n\n  If, on the other hand, the signal function was simpler and returned a singleton, like this:\n\n     (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n       (subscribe [:a-sub]))      ;; <-- returning a singleton\n\n  then the associated computation function must be written to expect a single value\n  as the 1st argument:\n\n      (fn [a query-vec]       ;; 1st argument is a single value\n         ...)\n\n  Further Note: variation #1 above, in which an `input-fn` was not supplied, like this:\n\n      (reg-sub\n        :query-id\n        a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n\n  is the equivalent of using this\n  2nd variation and explicitly suppling a `signal-fn` which returns `app-db`:\n\n      (reg-sub\n        :query-id\n        (fn [_ _]  re-frame/app-db)   ;; <--- explicit signal-fn\n        a-computation-fn)             ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n\n  **Third variation** - syntax Sugar\n\n      (reg-sub\n        :a-b-sub\n        :<- [:a-sub]\n        :<- [:b-sub]\n        (fn [[a b] query-vec]    ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n          {:a a :b b}))\n\n  This 3rd variation is just syntactic sugar for the 2nd.  Instead of providing an\n  `signals-fn` you provide one or more pairs of `:<-` and a subscription vector.\n\n  If you supply only one pair a singleton will be supplied to the computation function,\n  as if you had supplied a `signal-fn` returning only a single value:\n\n\n      (reg-sub\n        :a-sub\n        :<- [:a-sub]\n        (fn [a query-vec]      ;; only one pair, so 1st argument is a single value\n          ...))\n\n  For further understanding, read the tutorials, and look at the detailed comments in\n  /examples/todomvc/src/subs.cljs.\n        \n  See also: `subscribe`\n  \"\n  [query-id & args]\n  (apply subs/reg-sub (into [query-id] args)))\n\n(defn subscribe\n  \"Given a `query` vector, returns a Reagent `reaction` which will, over\n  time, reactively deliver a stream of values.
