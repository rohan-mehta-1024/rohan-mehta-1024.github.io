Chemical reactions are ane xample of how. We have this
colliding into one another but somehow....Unsurprisingly,
we can model this relationshipp by talking about how the
of

Let's imagine that we have some reaction that converts
reactions X to products Y at a constant rate. No matter
how much of reactants there, the reaction chugs along at 
the same speed - clearly, this is an idealized behavior
but its an easy place to start. We phrase this 
in terms of the following differential equation: 

A first attempt might consist of trying to integrate
both sides. However, we're treating A as a blackbox.
