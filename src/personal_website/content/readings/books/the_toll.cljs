      [:p  "I picked up the first installment of Neal Shusterman's
            The Arc of a Scythe trilogy all the way back in 2016,
            probably just a week or so after it came out, and even then,
            only on a whim (if I'm being honest, it was the cover art more
            than anything that drew me to it). But I was beyond rewarded
            with a masterfully told story that I will forever associate
            with dystopian fiction at its finest, and so finshing it
            leaves me with mixed emotions."]

      [:p "The trilogy examines the idea of a " [:q "post-mortal"] " world – a place
           where the steady advancement of medical technology has rendered almost all once-fatal
           injuries but a minor annoyance. As a consequence, state-sanctioned death has become a necessity
           to curb popualtion growth, and a global organization of
           professional killers known as Scythes have been tasked with carrying this
           business out."]

      [:p "But this organization, while acknowledged by the government, is not controlled by
           nor amenable to it. In fact, perhaps organization is the wrong
           word to use – it is a cult of self-styled angels and devils charged with taking
           the lives of others for a living, and thus given the status of gods. They are not
           beholden to the law in any way, and all that prevents them from bringing society
           to its knees are their increasingly lax morals, which, unsurpisingly,
           is the main conflict of the story. "]

      [:p "Moreover, it examines all of this in the context of a world run
           by a quasi-omnipotent (in its own words) general artifical intelligence,
           known as the Thunderhead – or the cloud
           is directly prohibited for interacting with this organization, for
           a machine can have no hand in human death, even if only by association.
           And so, this benevolent steward of mankind is forced to helplessly
           watch on as once  "]

      [:p "The Toll closes the trilogy, and in my opinion, does so magnificently.
           It builds out the of the more recent charactories, and the elegance
           in how it solves is. It is not just victory, there is an element of
           loss in it too. There is "]

        [:p "If I had to pick a favorite element from the book, it would
             be the way each chapter ends with the writings from a character's
             journal – it reminded me

In The Toll these snippets
             were religious wonderings from some far-flung future, where the
             organization had been disbanded. "]
