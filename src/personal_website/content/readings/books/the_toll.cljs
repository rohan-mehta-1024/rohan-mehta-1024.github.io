      [:p  "I picked up the first installment of Neal Shusterman's
            The Arc of a Scythe trilogy all the way back in 2016,
            probably just a week or so after it came out, and even then,
            only on a whim (if I'm being honest, it was the cover art more
            than anything that drew me to it). But I was beyond rewarded
            with a masterfully told story that I will forever associate
            with dystopian fiction at its finest, and so finshing it
            leaves me with mixed emotions."]

      [:p "The trilogy examines the idea of a " [:q "post-mortal"] " world – a place
           where the steady advancement of medical technology has rendered almost all once-fatal
           injuries but a minor annoyance. As a consequence, state-sanctioned death has become a necessity
           to curb population growth, and a global organization of
           professional killers known as Scythes have been tasked with the carrying out of this less than palatable
           business."]

      [:p "But while it is acknowledged by the government, this organization – known as
           the Scythedom – is neither controlled by
           nor amenable to it. In fact, perhaps " [:q "organization"] " is the wrong
           word alltogther. Something along the lines of a cult would be more accurate, for those
           charged with taking the lives of others for a living are invariably led
           to style themselves as either angels or devils, often with very little distinction."]

   [:p  "Regardless, their ability to act as judge, jury, and executioner whenever and wheresoever
         they please has erned Scythes the status of gods. Beholden to but ten commandments,
         they can more or less do what they please when they please it, and all that keeps
         them from turning are their increasingly lax morals, which unsurprisingly,
         represents the main conflict of the story."]

      [:p "That is, in and of itself, an exotic enough idea to grab anyone's attention. But
           the truly genius move on Shusterman's part comes from the context that this bizzarely unfolds in.
           Because while its power may seem absolute, the Scythedom only has jurasdiction over the dead.
           The world of the living, on the other hand, is governed by the Thunderhead:
           a benevolent, quasi-omnipotent (in its own words) general artifical intelligence."]


      [:p "The Toll closes the trilogy, and in my opinion, does so magnificently.
           It would be too monumental a task and try to do Shusterman's entire world
           justice in such a short reflection, so I'll focus instead on what I found
           most appealing about
            to try andBut most of all it closes things spectacularly.
           Too many a wonderful series stumble at the finish light, caught in
           an unatural act to tie things up neatly
           It builds out the of the more recent charactories, and the elegance
           in how it solves is. It is not just victory, there is an element of
           loss in it too. But most of all, it ends things perfectly. It
           is an imperfect ending, an impactful ending, and though I will
           admit I soemtimes"]

        [:p "If I had to pick a favorite element from the book, it would
             be the way each chapter ends with the writings from a character's
             journal – it reminded me

In The Toll these snippets
             were religious wonderings from some far-flung future, where the
             organization had been disbanded. "]
