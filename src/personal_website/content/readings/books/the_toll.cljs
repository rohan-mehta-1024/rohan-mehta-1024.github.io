      [:p  "I picked up the first installment of Neal Shusterman's
            The Arc of a Scythe trilogy all the way back in 2016,
            probably just a week or so after it came out, and even then,
            only on a whim (if I'm being honest, it was the cover art more
            than anything that drew me to it). But I was beyond rewarded
            with a masterfully told story that I will forever associate
            with dystopian fiction at its finest, and so finshing it
            leaves me with mixed emotions."]

      [:p "The trilogy examines the idea of a " [:q "post-mortal"] " world – a place
           where the steady advancement of medical technology has rendered almost all once-fatal
           injuries but a minor annoyance. As a consequence, state-sanctioned death has become a necessity
           to curb population growth, and a global organization of
           professional killers known as Scythes have been tasked with the carrying out of this less than palatable
           business."]

      [:p "But while it is acknowledged by the government, this organization is neither controlled by
           nor amenable to it. In fact, perhaps " [:q "organization"] " is the wrong
           word to use – it is a cult of self-styled angels and devils charged with taking
           the lives of others for a living, and thus granted the status of gods.
           As such, scythes are not beholden to the law in any way, and all that prevents
           them from bringing the world to its knees are their increasingly lax morals,
           which, unsurpisingly, represents the main conflict of the story. "]

        [:p "That is, in and of itself, an exotic enough idea to grab anyone's attention, but
             the truly genius move on Shusterman's part is what happens next. Because while
             it e, it does not exist in isolation. Just as it is tasked with the business
             of death, the Thunderhead, a quasi-ominpotent (in its own words) general artifical intelligence
             is charged with the business of life, with a caring hand."]


      [:p "The Toll closes the trilogy, and in my opinion, does so magnificently.
           It builds out the of the more recent charactories, and the elegance
           in how it solves is. It is not just victory, there is an element of
           loss in it too. But most of all, it ends things perfectly. It
           is an imperfect ending, an impactful ending, and though I will
           admit I soemtimes"]

        [:p "If I had to pick a favorite element from the book, it would
             be the way each chapter ends with the writings from a character's
             journal – it reminded me

In The Toll these snippets
             were religious wonderings from some far-flung future, where the
             organization had been disbanded. "]
